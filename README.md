#Learning Cli

learning cli is all about the basic git commands, making folders,files, and navigating through them.


I have learned the following:

1.*mkdir*-making folders

2.*touch*-creating files

3.*cat*-viewing file content

4.*cp*-copying folders and files and moving into them

5.*git init*-initializing git repos
